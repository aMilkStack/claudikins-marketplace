# Plan: Marketplace README Polish

**Session ID:** plan-2026-01-18-1318
**Created:** 2026-01-18
**Status:** Approved
**Klaus Review:** 7.5/10 (accepted as-is)
**Approach:** A - Full Restructure

---

## Problem Statement

The claudikins-marketplace README serves as the entry point for Claude Code users discovering the plugin ecosystem. While the current README has good bones (banner, badges, plugin table, detailed sections), it has several gaps that prevent optimal onboarding:

**Primary Issues:**
1. **No visual ecosystem map** - Plugin relationships are described in text but not visualised
2. **No progressive onboarding** - Single install command doesn't guide users by use case
3. **Missing prerequisites** - Users don't know what Claude Code version or dependencies are needed
4. **Minimal discoverability aids** - No TOC, no category filtering, no compatibility matrix

**User Impact:**
- New users spend >5 minutes understanding what to install
- Plugin relationships aren't immediately obvious
- No "Getting Started" path matched to user goals (workflow, docs, debugging)

---

## Scope & Boundaries

### In Scope

1. **README Restructure**
   - Add Table of Contents (plain text markers)
   - Add Prerequisites section (Claude Code version, recommended plugins)
   - Add "Getting Started by Use Case" section with 3 paths
   - Restructure plugin sections with collapsible details
   - Update Contributing section with submission guidelines

2. **Visual Ecosystem Diagram**
   - Create Mermaid flowchart showing plugin relationships
   - Show data flows: kernel to tool-executor, grfp to tool-executor, etc.
   - Embed directly in README (GitHub native rendering)

3. **Badge Enhancements**
   - Add GitHub Actions validation badge (if workflow exists)
   - Link existing badges to relevant pages
   - Consider adding "Claude Code Compatible" badge

4. **Plugin Relationship Documentation**
   - Add compatibility notes to each plugin section
   - Document which plugins enhance which workflows
   - Add "Works best with" callouts

### Out of Scope

- Plugin code changes (only docs)
- New plugins
- External website/directory
- Automated badge generation workflows
- marketplace.json schema changes
- Emojis (absolutely none)

---

## Success Criteria

1. **New user onboards in <5 minutes**
   - Measure: User can identify which plugins they need and install them from README alone
   - Test: Walk through README as a new user, time to first meaningful install

2. **Plugin relationships immediately obvious**
   - Measure: Mermaid diagram renders correctly, shows all 5 plugins and their connections
   - Test: Can explain relationships without reading prose

3. **Professional appearance**
   - Measure: Badges all link correctly, no broken images, consistent formatting
   - Test: Visual inspection, link validation

4. **Getting Started paths clear**
   - Measure: 3 distinct paths documented (workflow, docs, debugging)
   - Test: Each path has specific install commands and expected outcome

5. **Prerequisites documented**
   - Measure: Claude Code version requirement stated, any system dependencies listed
   - Test: Fresh user can verify they meet requirements before installing

| 14 | Add collapsible details for verbose sections | README.md | 11 | 3 |
| 15 | **CHECKPOINT: git commit** | - | 12-14 | 3 |
| 16 | Final review - test <5 min onboarding | - | 15 | 4 |
| 17 | Verify Mermaid renders on GitHub | - | 15 | 4 |

<!-- EXECUTION_TASKS_END -->

**Batch breakdown:**
- **Batch 1:** Core structure (diagram, TOC, prerequisites) + HUMAN REVIEW
- **Batch 2:** Plugin enhancements (use case paths, relationship callouts) + HUMAN REVIEW
- **Batch 3:** Polish (contributing, badges, collapsibles) + COMMIT
- **Batch 4:** Verification (onboarding test, render check)

**Note:** Actual README writing will use GRFP methodology for quality. This plan covers structure and requirements; GRFP handles prose.

## Dependencies

### Internal Task Dependencies

- Tasks 1-3 can run in parallel
- Task 4 is a human checkpoint
- Tasks 5-10 can run in parallel after checkpoint 4
- Task 11 is a human checkpoint
- Tasks 12-14 can run in parallel after checkpoint 11
- Task 15 requires all prior tasks
- Tasks 16-17 are verification, can run in parallel

### External Dependencies

- GitHub Mermaid rendering (native since Feb 2022)
- Shields.io for badges

### Plugin System Requirements

| Plugin | System Requirements |
|--------|---------------------|
| kernel | `jq`, `git`, `sha256sum`, `find` |
| tool-executor | Node.js, configured MCP servers |
| grfp | None (tool-executor STRONGLY RECOMMENDED) |
| klaus | None |
| acm | None |

### Plugin Ecosystem Map

```
                       kernel (core)
                           |
    +----------+-----------+-----------+----------+
    |          |           |           |          |
tool-executor grfp       klaus        acm --------+
    |          |           |           |          |
    |     (enhanced by     |           |          |
    +---- tool-executor)   |           +-- synergy with tool-executor
                           |                      |
                     (recommended                 |
                      for kernel)                 |
                           |                      |
                           +--- acm enhances all -+
```

### Key Relationships to Document

1. **kernel is RECOMMENDED for all plugins** - core workflow orchestrator
2. **klaus is RECOMMENDED for kernel users** - debugging companion for kernel workflows
3. **acm enhances EVERYTHING** - context preservation across all plugins
4. **tool-executor + acm have synergy** - context efficiency meets context preservation
5. **tool-executor enhances grfp** - provides Gemini MCP access
6. **grfp can run standalone** but strongly benefits from tool-executor

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| TOC links break on section rename | Medium | Low | Generate TOC after all sections finalised |
| Plugin hierarchy diagram doesn't capture nuance | Low | Medium | Iterate on diagram with human review at checkpoint |
| Missing system requirement for a plugin | Low | Medium | Cross-reference each plugin's actual README |

**Low-risk task overall** - this is documentation polish on a working marketplace. No code changes, no breaking changes, plugins remain untouched.
